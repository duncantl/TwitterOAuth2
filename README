This is code written by Duncan Temple Lang to collect information
from twitter. The idea is to collect data for the mid-term elections.
We start with a collection twitter account names, e.g., @RepRonBarber.
These are currently in "Arkansas.csv" (not actually a csv file)

We loop over each identifier and search for tweets with this id as content.
The searchTwitter() function does this.
We then save the results in a directory Data/<id>/<num>.rda
where <id> is replaced by the twitter id and <num> is the next
file number in that directory.

We then repeat this indefinitely.
When we return to process an identifier, we need to limit
our search to only include those tweets since the last search.
